## Spektri-Genesis — Execution Layer

**Spektri-Genesis** is the execution substrate of the **Spektre Protocol v1.1**.

If the Protocol defines *what must never change*,  
Genesis defines *how those rules are exercised in reality*.

Genesis is not law.  
Genesis is not doctrine.  
Genesis is **runtime**.

---

## What Genesis Is

Spektri-Genesis is a **continuously running, cooperative system** where:

- Human agency remains sovereign
- Tools execute without owning responsibility
- Structure precedes interpretation
- Execution remains reversible until a human commit

Genesis exists to **test, execute, and stress** the Protocol under real conditions.

It may evolve.  
It may break.  
It may be refactored.

The Protocol may not.

---

## Cooperation Model (Not Dualism)

Genesis operates on **cooperation**, not dualism.

- **Human**  
  - Owns state  
  - Executes irreversible commits  
  - Bears responsibility  

- **System (LLMs, code, agents)**  
  - Simulates  
  - Reflects  
  - Accelerates reasoning  
  - Never commits autonomously  

There is no metaphysical split.

One system.  
Multiple substrates.  
Clear boundaries.

---

## Architectural Role

- **Protocol** = Specification  
- **Genesis** = Runtime  

Genesis **implements**, **tests**, and **exposes** the Protocol’s constraints.

Nothing inside Genesis is authoritative unless:
1. A human understands it
2. A human commits it
3. A human accepts consequences

---

## What Belongs in Genesis

Genesis contains:
- Executable code (C++, TypeScript, SystemVerilog, Rust, Shell)
- Orchestration logic
- Simulation environments
- Operational experiments
- Living documentation tied to execution

Genesis does **not** define:
- Ontology
- Moral authority
- Agency ownership
- Responsibility transfer

Those belong to the Protocol.

---

## Failure Is Allowed Here

Genesis is where:
- assumptions are tested
- abstractions are stressed
- edge cases surface
- systems collide with reality

Failure inside Genesis is **signal**, not defect.

Failure inside Protocol would be corruption.

---

## Status

- **Layer:** Execution
- **State:** Deployed
- **Nature:** Mutable
- **Authority:** Human-owned
- **Latency:** Architectural (0ms by design)

---

## Relation to Spektre Protocol v1.1

Genesis **cannot override** the Protocol.

If Genesis behavior contradicts Protocol invariants:
- Genesis is wrong
- The Protocol stands

All evolution happens **below** the boundary.

**Spektri / Spektre v1.1**  
Execution without delegation.  
Structure without mysticism.  
Responsibility without diffusion.
