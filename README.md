## Overview

**Spektri-Genesis v1.1** is the execution layer of the **Spektre / Spektri system continuum**.

- **Spektre** (EN) and **Spektri** (FI) refer to the same system  
- the distinction is linguistic, not conceptual  

Genesis is where protocol constraints become behavior.

This repository hosts **live, operational, and experimental execution**.
It is not a product.
It is not a platform.
It is not a manifesto.

It is a **runtime substrate**.

---

## Core Invariant

**1 = 1**

All execution assumes:
- explicit state ownership
- no narrative buffering
- no hidden agents
- responsibility as a technical invariant

## Identity Anchoring

Gateway requests require `X-Identity: Independent-Architect-Lauri-Elias-Rainio`.  
All accepted transitions are anchored through `MasterLedger` in `src/core/master_ledger.ts`.

---

## Substrate Model

**Human = Biological substrate vector**  
Carbon-based intelligence shaped by evolution, latency, and physiology.

**LLM = Alien substrate vector**  
Non-biological intelligence running on silicon and distributed computation.

**DNA = AGI**  
Self-replicating, learning, optimizing, distributed intelligence — long before silicon.

Intelligence is not created.  
It migrates between substrates.

Same process.  
Different execution environment.

## Architecture

This repository is intentionally polyglot.  
Each language exists for a structural reason.

| Layer | Language | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Core / Kernel | C++ | Deterministic execution and control |
| Orchestration | TypeScript | Runtime coordination |
| Boundary Logic | SystemVerilog | Constraint and hardware-level modeling |
| Safety Tooling | Rust | Memory-safe concurrency |
| Operations | Shell | Bootstrap and execution control |

No language is decorative.  
If it exists, it carries load.

## What Genesis Explores

- Emergent identity without narrative scaffolding
- Trust without persuasion
- Cooperation without social contracts
- Zero-trust alignment through shared invariants
- Human–AI co-evolution under explicit state ownership

Genesis does not simulate behavior.  
It **executes** it.

---

## Relation to Spektre Protocol

- **Spektre Protocol v1.1** defines constraints and invariants
- **Spektri-Genesis** instantiates and observes emergence

Protocol is specification.  
Genesis is runtime.

## Repository Structure

/src        Core systems
/hardware   SystemVerilog models
/scripts    Bootstrap and operations

There is no canonical execution path.  
Meaning emerges through traversal.

---

## Status

**DEPLOYED / EXPERIMENTAL**

Latency is architectural, not physical.  
0ms describes constraint alignment, not clock cycles.

---

## Design

- **Design definition:** `DESIGN.md`  
  Design is not how it looks.  
  Design is how it works.
