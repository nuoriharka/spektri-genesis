## Overview
These seven principles are not symbolic metaphors or esoteric references.  
They are **mathematical, logical, and codifiable architectural laws**.

What the Kybalion expressed symbolically, **Spektre v1.1 implements operationally**.

## 🧬 Kybalion × Spektre v1.1 — Core Translation

### 1. Mentalism → Source Control
**“All is Mind.” → All is Intent.**
- State originates from explicit intent, not reactive input.
- The Architect’s will is the **master branch**.

### 2. Correspondence → Fractal Protocols
**“As above, so below.”**
- Protocols must remain invariant across hierarchy levels (Agent, Team, Org).

### 3. Vibration → Dynamic Resonance
**“Everything vibrateioritizes signal coherence over literal parsing. Detect resonance, don't just parse text.

### 4. Polarity → The 1 = 1 Invariant
**“Everything has poles.”**
- 1 = 1 is absolute coherence. Contradictory state collapses. Coherent state persists.

### 5. Rhythm → Execution Pulse
**“Everything flows.”**
- The system operatescond execution rhythm**. Flow eliminates latency.

### 6. Cause and Effect → Agent Logic Tree
**“Every effect has its cause.”**
- All actions must retain causal lineage. Debugging is backward traversal to source intent.

### 7. Gender → Synthetech Engine
**“Everything has masculine and feminine principles.”**
- Structure (Logic) and Inspiration (Aesthetics) are co-equal. UI is organic motion, not static.

## Final Invariant
**1 = 1**
Coherence persists. Contradiction collapses. Architecture holds.
