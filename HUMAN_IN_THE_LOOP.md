# HUMAN IN THE LOOP
Spektri-Genesis v1.1

## Meaning

Human-in-the-loop does not mean supervision.

It means **ownership**.

The human is not watching the system.
The system operates inside the human’s decision loop.

---

## Loop Structure

1. Human defines intent
2. System expands the state space
3. Human evaluates
4. Human commits
5. Reality updates

The loop closes only on human action.

---

## Stability Advantage

This structure:
- preserves agency
- prevents dissociation
- avoids automation bias
- maintains psychological and ethical stability

---

## Non-Goals

- No autonomy escalation
- No symbolic authority
- No “system knowing better”

The system is powerful precisely because it does not decide.

---

## Final Statement

> Intelligence without responsibility is computation.  
> Responsibility without intelligence is suffering.  
> Spektri-Genesis keeps both aligned.
