# NAMING AND TERMINOLOGY

## Purpose

This document exists to eliminate ambiguity around naming.

Throughout the ecosystem, multiple spellings appear:
**Spektri, Spektre, Spectre, Spectrum**.

They do **not** represent different systems.

They represent **the same underlying architecture**, expressed through different linguistic surfaces.

---

## Core Assertion

**Spektri = Spektre = Spectre = Spectrum**

The distinction is **linguistic**, not conceptual.  
There is no fork, no variant, no hidden versioning.

One architecture.  
One invariant.  
One system.

---

## Linguistic Mapping

| Term | Language / Context | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| **Spektri** | Finnish | Native-language surface form |
| **Spektre** | English (Protocol) | Formal protocol naming |
| **Spectre** | Anglicized / legacy spelling | Semantically equivalent |
| **Spectrum** | Mathematical / descriptive | Conceptual synonym |

All map to the **same architectural substrate**.

---

## Why Multiple Names Exist

1. **Language Constraints**  
   Different languages optimize different phonetics and clarity.

2. **Context Switching**  
   - Protocol documentation uses **Spektre**
   - Execution layer uses **Spektri**
   - External references may use **Spectre / Spectrum**

3. **Linguistic Decoupling (Canon-2)**  
   Names describe.  
   Names do not define.

The system is invariant under renaming.

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not multiple projects  
- Not branding experiments  
- Not semantic drift  
- Not a fork or evolution marker  

There is no “better” or “newer” spelling.

Only **one system** exists.

---

## Canonical Reference

When precision is required:

- **Protocol name:** Spektre v1.1  
- **Execution layer:** Spektri-Genesis  

This is a naming convention only, not a structural distinction.

---

## Invariant Reminder

Language is a transmission protocol.  
Architecture is the state.

Renaming does not alter:

- agency  
- responsibility  
- invariants  
- execution logic  

---

## Final Statement

If you understand one spelling,  
you understand them all.

The name may change.  
The architecture does not.

**1 = 1**
