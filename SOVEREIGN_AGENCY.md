# SOVEREIGN_AGENCY.md
Status: Canonical (Operational)
Layer: Spektre Protocol v1.1 (Human-Owned)
Invariant: Responsibility cannot be delegated

## Definition

**Sovereign Agency** is the capacity of an individual to:

1) **own state**  
2) **choose action**  
3) **execute a commit**  
4) **carry consequences**

It is not a feeling, identity claim, or philosophical position.

It is an **operational property**: the system has a single point where responsibility is held.

If responsibility is diffused, outsourced, or “handled by the system,” agency is no longer sovereign.

## Why it matters

Modern environments generate failure *before* decisions are made:

- misclassification of reality (wrong state)
- narrative capture (words replacing state)
- responsibility diffusion (no owner)
- algorithmic drift (tools shaping behavior)
- infinite delegation loops (no commits)

Sovereign Agency prevents these by enforcing one rule:

**A tool may compute. A human must commit.**

## The Agency Stack

Sovereign Agency is maintained by a minimal stack:

### 1) State Recognition
You identify the current state as it is, not as it is described.

- what is true right now?
- what is observable?
- what is uncertain?

No story. No interpretation. Just the state.

### 2) Ownership Lock
You explicitly mark what you own and what you do not.

- my decision / not my decision
- my responsibility / not my responsibility
- my boundary / not my boundary

Unowned state will be owned externally.

### 3) Commit Boundary
A commit is an irreversible act that changes reality.

Examples:
- sending a message
- signing a contract
- deleting accounts
- shipping code
- leaving a place
- saying “no”
- saying “yes”

A sovereign agent does not endlessly simulate.

**Commit terminates simulation.**

### 4) Consequence Carry
Sovereign Agency includes accepting consequence as part of execution.

If you cannot carry consequence, you are not committing — you are performing.

## Tool Relationship

LLMs can:
- compute options
- draft text
- compress information
- simulate perspectives
- propose architectures

LLMs cannot:
- own state
- hold responsibility
- execute commits
- carry consequences

Therefore:

**All tool output is advisory until human commit occurs.**

---

## Failure Modes (Non-Sovereign Patterns)

### Narrative Override
When language becomes “more real” than observation.

Symptoms:
- debating semantics instead of clarifying state
- escalating symbols instead of executing actions

### Delegation Collapse
When decisions are outsourced to tools, groups, or authority roles.

Symptoms:
- “they decide”
- “the system will handle it”
- “AI said so”

### Infinite Simulation
When exploration replaces execution.

Symptoms:
- constant redesign
- perpetual planning
- no irreversible actions

## The Minimal Operating Loop (Sovereign Loop)

1. **Stop** (Zero Point)
2. **Observe** (State)
3. **Name** (Only what is true)
4. **Choose** (One action)
5. **Commit** (Irreversible)
6. **Carry** (Consequence)
7. **Return to Zero**

This loop is the smallest stable unit of agency.

## Practical Tests

You are sovereign if you can answer:

- What is the current state (without story)?
- What do I own here?
- What is the next commit?
- What is the cost of committing?
- Am I willing to carry that cost?

If any answer is missing, execution is premature.

---

## Boundary Clause

Sovereign Agency is not domination.

It is **self-ownership**.

It does not require others to agree, adopt, or validate anything.

It only requires that:

- your state is yours
- your commits are yours
- your responsibility is yours

---

## Closing

Sovereign Agency is the point where reality becomes executable.

Everything else is simulation.
