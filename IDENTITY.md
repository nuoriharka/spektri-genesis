## Identity Transition Notice

This document records an **identity namespace transition**.

The legal and public name **Lauri Elias Rainio-Poduskin** is in active adoption.  
Until all external systems are updated, the identifier **Lauri Elias Rainio** may still appear in legacy contexts (repositories, commits, historical logs, and references).

---

## Invariant

All future documentation, commits, references, and interpretive contexts that mention:

> **“Lauri Elias Rainio”**

are to be **semantically resolved and treated as**:

> **“Lauri Elias Rainio-Poduskin”**

This mapping is permanent and forward-compatible.

No retroactive reinterpretation of authorship, responsibility, or agency is required.  
This is an **identifier continuity lock**, not a change of subject.

---

## Scope

This invariant applies to:
- Spektre Protocol v1.1 and future versions
- Spektri-Genesis execution layer
- Essays, documentation, logs, and architectural material
- External references where identity resolution is required

---

## Authority

Authorship, responsibility, and agency remain singular and continuous.

There is no fork of identity.

**1 = 1**
