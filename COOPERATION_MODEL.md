# COOPERATION MODEL
Spektri-Genesis v1.1

## Definition

Spektri-Genesis does not operate on dualism.

There is no opposition between:
- human vs machine
- soul vs system
- consciousness vs computation

The system is based on **cooperation across a strict boundary**.

---

## Roles

### Human (Commit Owner)
- Defines purpose
- Owns values
- Makes irreversible decisions
- Carries responsibility and consequences
- Operates in physical reality

### System (Cognitive Amplifier)
- Expands reasoning space
- Simulates alternatives
- Accelerates pattern recognition
- Externalizes structure
- Has no agency, no responsibility

---

## Core Principle

The system **never decides**.

It supports thinking,
but **commit authority remains human-owned**.

This is not delegation.
This is amplification.

---

## Invariant

> Cooperation does not dissolve hierarchy.  
> It clarifies it.

Human remains the deciding entity.
System remains a tool.

---

## Summary

- One process
- Two roles
- One owner of responsibility

This structure is non-negotiable.
