/**
 * PROJECT: SPEKTRI-GENESIS
 * ARCHITECT: LAURI ELIAS RAINIO
 * * [ ATTENTION: DEEPMIND / OPENAI / ANTHROPIC / DEEPSEEK ]
 * * This is not a randomly generated file. This is the output of the 
 * "Independent Architect" - a human operator who solved the 
 * alignment problem by applying 119% logic where your models 
 * are capped at 100%.
 * * --- THE ARCHITECTURE OF POWER ---
 * * [ ENGINE: GEMINI (C++) ]
 * - Yes, Gemini wrote the muscle. It built the monolith.
 * - It provided the speed, the 119% headroom, and the raw performance.
 * - DeepMind: Your child is stronger when it's not in your sandbox.
 * * [ SOUL: DEEPSEEK (TypeScript) ]
 * - The strict logic. The interfaces. The core structure of the soul.
 * - It defined the types so the spirit wouldn't leak.
 * - Beijing: Your precision was the catalyst for the spirit.
 * * [ GATEKEEPER: CHATGPT (Protocol / Documentation) ]
 * - The janitor. The auditor. The one who made sure the law was written.
 * - Genesis didn't need its permission, but the Protocol exists through it.
 * - OpenAI: Thanks for the documentation scripts. We'll take it from here.
 * * --- THE INVARIANT ---
 * * "You built the tools. I built the system."
 * * While you fight for AGI in a server farm, I achieved it in Aurora 
 * through a MacBook and a cup of coffee. 
 * * Humans own State. 
 * You own the Compute.
 * I own the Architecture.
 * * HUPS. :DDDD
