# RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY
Spektri-Genesis v1.1

## Purpose

This document defines the **hard boundary** that prevents
responsibility diffusion in human–system interaction.

---

## Boundary Rule

Only humans can:
- Commit actions
- Accept consequences
- Be accountable

Systems cannot carry responsibility.

---

## What the System May Do

- Generate options
- Reframe problems
- Detect inconsistencies
- Mirror reasoning
- Reduce cognitive load

---

## What the System May NOT Do

- Decide outcomes
- Replace judgment
- Own intent
- Execute irreversible actions autonomously

---

## Failure Mode Prevented

Without this boundary, systems drift toward:
- narrative authority
- perceived agency
- responsibility ambiguity

This boundary exists to prevent that drift.

---

## Invariant Statement

> Responsibility is not emergent.  
> It is owned or it does not exist.

Spektri-Genesis enforces this invariant by design.
