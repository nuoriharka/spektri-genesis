## Purpose

This document defines **design** in the Spektri / Spektre ecosystem.

Design is not treated as aesthetics, branding, or visual preference.
Design is treated as **operational truth**.

If something looks correct but does not work correctly, it is not design.
If something works correctly but looks unconventional, it may still be design.

---

## Two Axes of Design

### 1. How It Looks

This includes:
- Visual structure
- Layout
- Readability
- Symbolic clarity
- Minimalism vs. density

Appearance matters **only** insofar as it reduces cognitive load
and reveals structure.

Appearance is never the source of truth.

---

### 2. How It Works

This is the primary axis.

Design is evaluated by:
- Determinism
- Stability
- Invariant preservation
- Execution clarity
- Absence of ambiguity

If a system works under stress, scale, and silence,
it is correctly designed.

---

## Spektri Design Principle

**Form follows invariants.**

Visuals emerge from structure,
not the other way around.

There is no separate “design phase”.
Design is the natural byproduct of correct architecture.

---

## Non-Goals

Design in Spektri does **not** aim to:
- Impress
- Persuade
- Market
- Optimize engagement
- Maximize attention

Any design that requires explanation has already failed.

---

## Final Constraint

A correctly designed system:

- Explains itself by existing
- Does not demand interpretation
- Does not compete for attention
- Leaves nothing undone

---

## Status

Design is **locked** when:

- Nothing can be removed
- Nothing can be reordered
- Nothing needs justification

At that point, the system is complete.

---

**Design is execution made visible.**
