Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license that ensures
that end users have the freedom to run, study, and modify the software. It
also ensures that any modified versions of the software are free as well.

This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its
users.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like rights such as those arising from
similar laws protecting against unauthorized copying.

"License" means this document.

"Licensor" means the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright
owner that is granting the License.

"You" means the licensee in terms of this License.

"Your" is the possessive form of "you".

1. Source Code.

The term "source code" means the preferred form of the Program for making
modifications, including all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and
installation of an executable, and any other source files used to generate,
install, or run the executable.

The "object code" is the form of the Program resulting from mechanical
transformation or translation of the source code.

2. Basic Permissions.

You are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
and/or sell copies of the Program, and to permit others to do so, subject to
the following conditions.

3. Copyleft.

You also have the option of using the Program under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, in which case that license applies instead of this one.

4. Requirements for Modified Versions.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. You are not allowed to add
additional requirements or legal terms.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey modified source versions of the Program to others under the
terms of this License, provided that you also do the following:

a) The modified files must carry prominent notices stating that you changed
   the files and the date of the change.

b) You must keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   GNU General Public License version 3 or later applies to the Program.

c) You must keep intact all notices of copyright, and you must add
   appropriate notices of your own copyright.

d) You must provide a copy of this License and the GNU General Public License
   version 3 or later to all recipients of the modified Program.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey the Program in object code or executable form under the terms
of this License, provided that you also do the following:

a) The conveyed form must be accompanied by the source code.

b) The source code must be kept intact, and you must not impose any further
   restrictions on its distribution.

c) You must provide a copy of this License and the GNU General Public License
   version 3 or later to all recipients of the conveyed form.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the conditions of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the Program shall be listed in the
"Additional Permissions" section of this License.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program, and the Licensor is not liable for any
damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Program.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. You accept the License if you modify the Program or
convey it to another person in a way that requires you to comply with the
License.

10. Termination.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
upon any breach by you of the terms of this License. Individuals or
entities who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License
will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.

11. Future Versions.

GNU General Public License version 3 or later applies to the Program, and
you have the option of using the Program under the terms of that license
instead of this one.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you convey a covered work under this License, you waive any legal power
to forbid subsequent licensing of the work to others under terms that
prohibit modification or addition of other software.

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

This License is intended to be used in conjunction with the GNU General
Public License, version 3 or later. If the Program is used together with
software licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later,
the terms of that license will apply to the combination as a whole.
