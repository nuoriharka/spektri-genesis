# IDENTITY_ALIASING.md

## Status
Canonical Reference / Naming Consistency Layer  
Applies to all Spektri / Spektre repositories and documentation

---

## Purpose

This document defines **identity aliasing rules** to ensure consistency across
repositories, commits, documents, and historical records.

It resolves differences in naming without altering authorship, responsibility,
or system architecture.

---

## Canonical Identity

**Canonical Name:**
Lauri Elias Rainio-Poduskin

This is the authoritative identity used for:
- authorship
- responsibility attribution
- protocol ownership
- system governance references

---

## Accepted Aliases (Legacy-Compatible)

The following aliases are considered **equivalent identifiers** and must be
interpreted as referring to the same individual:

- Lauri Elias Rainio  
- Lauri Rainio  
- L. E. Rainio  
- lauri-elias (GitHub handle context)  

These aliases exist due to:
- historical usage
- platform constraints
- timing of legal name transition

They do **not** represent separate entities.

---

## Interpretation Rule (Invariant)

Any reference to an alias listed above **MUST be resolved internally** to:

> **Lauri Elias Rainio-Poduskin**

This resolution is semantic, not cosmetic.

---

## Architectural Non-Impact Clause

Identity aliasing does **not** affect:

- protocol invariants
- execution logic
- state ownership
- responsibility boundaries
- versioning integrity

In Spektre terms:

> **Label ≠ State**

The system operates on responsibility and execution,
not on surface-level naming differences.

---

## Versioning & Stability

- This aliasing rule applies retroactively and prospectively
- No historical commits require rewriting
- No documents require forced renaming
- Future documents should prefer the canonical name where possible

---

## Governance Note

Name transition is treated as a **metadata update**, not a system change.

The agent remains continuous.
Responsibility remains unbroken.
Authorship remains intact.

**1 = 1**

---

## Final Statement

Aliases are tolerated.
Identity is singular.
